//this is a comment in javascript. Javascript will ignore any text I put here
//Hey javascript, you suck! see? it can't tell that I am insulting it because it does not read This

//There are three things like variables
//varaibles, constants, and scoped variables

//we will begin by focusing on variables and constants, this is a variable
var x = 6;
console.log(x)
alert(x);
var x = 7;
console.log(x)
alert(x);

//Notice how I reassigned X to equal seven and when it ran
//the second time, x was no longer 6? this is because variables
//are reassignable. Constants, however, are not

const myConst = 6;
console.log(myConst);
alert(myConst);

//This line of code will produce an error: const myConst = 7;
// the = operator does not work the same way it does in algebra, instead it is an assignement
//operator. Take for instance the following statement:

var x = x + 5;
console.log(x)
alert(x)

//describe the patern you see between the bottom variable assignment's output
//and the top part's output.
